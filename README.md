# SSD W3 NG
SSD official website built in AngularJS.

## Background
This project was seeded from the AngularJS default seed project.

## Development

### Running the app in development

- Install Git, NodeJS, NPM, Bower, Grunt
- Clone this Git repo
- cd [top-level-dir-of-this-project]
- execute:  bower install
- You should see the dependencies defined in bower.json now in bower_components/

To run the app locally pick one of these options:
* serve this repository with your own webserver such as apache or IIS
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.


### Running the app in production

This site is designed to be run under Apache or another similar, legit, prime-time-ready web server.  Not NodeJS or Express -- maybe they'll grow up in ~10 years or so.

Deployment instructions for this site in production are available in the wiki for this repo.

### Running unit tests

Use [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files

### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the [end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`

### Continuous Integration

A pattern for CI is available from:
Cloudbees
<a href="https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart/master/clickstart.json"><img src="https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png"/></a>

If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo,  along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
